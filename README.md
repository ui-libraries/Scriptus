Scriptus
========

Omeka plugin for DIY History to perform transcription actions. Uses a proprietary image viewer that must be purchased for $11 if used in production. TODO: switch out with open source image viewer

Note: You will need to add a few rows to your omeka database before using this. At some point I will add to the hookInstall function of ScriptusPlugin.php, but for now, run these manually.
